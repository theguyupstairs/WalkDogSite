# Dog Walking Website 

### A brief Summary

I have two dogs, a poodle and a golden retriever, who I love greatly. It has been a long-held frustration of mine that some people don't walk their dogs enough. To solve this problem, I decided to make a website that would gamify dog-walking to the best of my ability. 

### The Website

At the most superficial level, the website gives you access to a dog-themed route planner. You can create routes by interactively adding and removing dog-themed markers. As you change your route, you get a direct calculation of your route's distance, allowing you to plan your path precisely. For users who wan't more than this feature, they can create an account and save their routes. They can later retrieve this route information, including time and distance, for weekly and monthly intervals. Finally, the greatest gamification step is allowing users to link their account to a family-unit through a family name. This allows them to check, for both monthly and weekly intervals, their family leaderboard for time and distance walked.

### Tech Stack

The tech stack used for this app is React, Asp.Net Core and Microsoft SQL Server. I decided to use React for the front-end because of the simple nature of this website. Being a primarily map-based, single page application, I wen't with the frontend framework I felt was more comfortable to use. For the backend, I chose Asp.Net because I wanted to get some c# practice. I also wanted to learn Entity Framework (EF) Core because, through its Object Relational Mapping, it provides the ability to build good backend systems quickly. Finally, I used Microsoft SQL Server because of its simple integration to .Net and EF Core. Since I wasn't planning on publishing this website, the higher costs of SQL Server weren't an issue.
